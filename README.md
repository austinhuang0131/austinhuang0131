You can ask me anything [in this repository's issue section](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/austinhuang0131/issues) if the question is suitable for public. See [here](https://austinhuang.me/#hey-you-look-cool) for more methods to reach me.

* I mostly manage stuff rather than code stuff directly.
  * I made Barinsta. [You know how that ended up.](https://austinhuang.me/barinsta)
  * I have founded ![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Discord-7289da?logo=discord&logoColor=white)-related projects like [DTel](https://github.com/dtel-hq/dtel) and [Discoin](https://github.com/discoin).
    * I am no longer as involved in Discord-related projects *as before*. You can see my rationale [here](https://austinhuang.me/discord-issues).
* I also throw in a few PRs for projects that I personally use. Check out [my Codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/austinhuang.me) as well!
