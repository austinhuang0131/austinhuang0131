* I mostly manage stuff rather than code stuff directly.
  * I made Barinsta. [You know how that ended up.](https://austinhuang.me/barinsta)
  * I have founded Discord-related projects like [DTel](https://github.com/dtel-hq/dtel) and [Discoin](https://github.com/discoin), though I am now a supporter of [Matrix](https://matrix.org).
* I also throw in a few PRs for projects that I personally use. Check out [my Codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/austinhuang.me) as well!
